# Party Rental

##### Second year java project with mariadb

## Getting Started
#### I recommend using the versions and applications mentioned below. Why do I recommend HeidiSQL? Because the DB was created using HeidiSQL, as that is faster and more reliable, and exported as SQL. I have once tried running such exported SQL before, but I encountered an error, therefore I recommend using HeidiSQL for DB setup.
#### Once HeidiSQL is installed copy init.sql and paste it into a query tab before hitting run.
